# Welcome to the JuiceRescue Organization.

On 10/2/2024, Enel X Way announced that US operations for their residential and commercial EV chargers would cease, effective immediately.

This group is focused on keeping the hardware owned by countless individuals and businesses functional, enabling the continued growth of electric vehicles without financial setback to replace these devices.

## Our goals

* Make it easier for non-technical people to set up juicepassproxy, so they can monitor/control, and connect to Home Assistant
* Make it easier for utilities and other organizations to bridge between Juiceboxes and OCPP
* Support ongoing maintenance of the hardware
* Understand and navigate the ongoing security/safety risks with a product no longer supported by the OEM

## Great! How can I regain control of my Juicebox?

For residential users of Juicebox, the [Juicepass Proxy project](https://github.com/JuiceRescue/juicepassproxy) is the best place to start. This is not a plug and play solution (yet!), but is a platform that can pair with Home Assistant and some settings on your local router/DNS server to help enable some of the familiar features of the Enel app.
